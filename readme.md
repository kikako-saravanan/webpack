# 🧱 Webpack Practical Learning Repository

This repository is a **hands-on playground** for mastering **Webpack** concepts step by step.
It follows a chapter-based structure where each concept is explored in depth through multiple real-world challenges and coding exercises.

---

## 📘 Overview

Webpack is a **powerful and flexible module bundler** for modern JavaScript applications.
This repository is designed to help you **learn by doing** — each chapter focuses on one major Webpack concept and includes **five progressively difficult challenges** that help you understand both fundamentals and advanced usage patterns.
